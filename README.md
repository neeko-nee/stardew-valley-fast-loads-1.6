# Neeko Nee notes

## Updated to .Net 6.0

## Tested on 1.6 with 620 mods, has some trouble at times but when it works it does load the game ~30% faster

It is a bit inneficient as I don't really know how to code and didn't properly update it to work properly with 1.6

Mostly unnecesary now with 1.6 loading faster but some people (including myself) wanted it updated
